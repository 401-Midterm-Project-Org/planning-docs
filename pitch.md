# Project Ideas

## Brainstorming

Grab a whiteboard and brainstorm ideas. During this phase, there is no comment or criticism of ideas. Ideas should be given in the form of titles or very short phrases. If an explanation is needed, save it for the pitch round.

## Sup, Pitches?

Once a critical mass of ideas has been written down, the person who offered the idea will give a pitch. Each pitch may be no longer than 2 to 3 minutes. The purpose of a pitch is to sell the idea to your group mates. During this phase, questions may be asked, but the discussion should be limited. Keep it short and to the point.

At the end of the pitch, you should have formed a short list of favorites.

Once your team had decided on 1 or 2 favorites, prepare your pitches for submission.

Each pitch should contain the following information:

- Name of Project
- Summary of idea.
- What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
  - What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
