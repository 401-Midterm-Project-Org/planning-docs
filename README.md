- Code reviews before things get pushed and merged

## Conflict Plan

*Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.*

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

- Address concerns with individual directly first
- If issue persists, bring in Jacob as mediator
- Maintain a communicative and empathetic environment so everyone feels comfortable bringing up concerns
- Understand that concerns are not personal, we want to make sure the group thrives as a whole

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

- Address concerns with individual directly first
  - we will assume that this is done out of enthusiasm and not with malicious intent
- If issue persists, bring in Jacob as mediator
- Work together in pair programming sessions to help avoid miscommunication with blockers

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

- Pair programming
- Code reviews
- Approach each day knowing we are all trying to learn
- Don't be embarrassed to ask how portion of the code work

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

- Address concerns with individual directly first
  - Understand that sometimes periods of silence are simply periods of thought
- Discuss ideas for the code that still needs to be completed - ask what they would like to work on
- Offer up pair programming sessions

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

- Strike Three: if a direct address and group address do not resolve the concern, bring in Jacob for assistance

## Communication Plan

*Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.*

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**

- 9am - 6pm officially
- after hours as needed and agreed upon

**What platforms will you use to communicate?**

- Discord (primary)
- Slack

**How often will you take breaks?**

- Take breaks as needed
- Official noon lunch - subject to how everyone is feeling

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

- Work into the evenings when necessary
- Worst case scenario: reassess our MVP

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

- Messages are acceptable, but with the knowledge that they might not get answered right away

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

- Give everyone an opportunity to share during the morning stand ups
- Create an environment where people feel free to contribute or bring up concerns

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

- Be respectful with one another

## Work Plan

*Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.*

**How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

- Discuss in morning sessions what we hope to achieve in the day
- Code reviews daily to identify what has been accomplished

**What project management tool will be used?**

- Going to give GitHub Projects a try

## Git Process

*Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.*

**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**

- Backend repository
- Frontend repository
- Project planning

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**

- Create an organization and have all teammates as members

**What is your Git flow?**

- Create a staging branch
- Only push to main what is in a working state

**What is the PR review workflow?**

- Two reviewers to approve pull requests
- Administrative override allowed if we have all reviewed code together or mob programmed
